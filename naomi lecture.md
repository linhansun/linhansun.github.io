###Trust in science? Why?
How do we know when to trust science?

Vaccine/GMO/climate change
### Uncertainty in science
- To some uncertainty seems to be ground for doubting science
- Exploit uncertainty to attack sciences they don't like

###Belief or Faith?
- **Pascal's wager**: Prove the existence of God
/"Better safe than sorry"
- Is science a leap of faith?
- Risks of accepting science is smaller
- Not just to ordinary people (scientists outside certain field)

###Should we trust science?
- Traditional view: scientific method (hypothetic deductive method)
- Relativity and astronomy observation 
(Deductive nomological model: searching for law of nature)
- Problem: fallacy of affirming the consequent (any other reasons)
- False theories could make true prediction:
Ptolemyâ€˜s universe
- 2nd problem: auxiliary hypothesis 
- Treat Other assumptions as true
- Indirectly trust in our instruments
- stellar parallax 
- Auxiliary hypothesis 1: earth orbit is large
- Auxiliary hypothesis 2: telescope sensitive enough

- Oversimplified picture of science
- Science that doesn't follow deduction 

- **Inductive science**: generalization (Sherlock Holmes)

- Mid 20th century: thought inductive out of fashion
>"stamp collecting"-Rutherford

- Charles Darwin- testing nothing at first
- **Both way can work **

- **Modeling**: physical/computer simulations 
(Attribution of gases in greenhouse effect)

- Paul Feyerabend "anything goes" 

##What is in common: Evidence 
- Evidence is the key element of scientific method

- Who judges evidence?
- How do scientists decide when they have enough evidence?
- By **Consensus** 
- Scientific knowledge are claims that have been argued upon by experts 
- Supported by sufficient evidence 
- Appeal to authority?
- Authority of group, not individuals 
- Jury of scientific peers
- Crowd sourcing (Internet becomes a problem for science)
- Collective work, accumulating of expertise and experience (as your car)

- Science as a process
- By and large it mostly works

## How do we judge a particular claim?
- Trust is not faith
- Trust a process, not thinking it is infallible 
- We don't abandon trust when it makes mistakes (friends and families)



	1.	**Fads and fashions**: journalists (e.g. Cold fusion) -wait and see, replication comes in 
	2.	**Hype**: over promised (James Watson: Human Genome tells us that what it is to be human; God particle)- extreme ( famous man raising money or out of bound of the field of investigation)
	3.	**Nonsense**: critical positivity ratio- not abandon common sense, counter intuitive or ridiculous 
	4.	**Corruption**: funding effects (desired of funders), sometimes subconscious (study design) (other people would be influenced but we can't lol) peer review is necessary but not sufficient (tobacco industry)- disclosure of funding source (altered to potential bias to both readers and scientists) as a form of epistemic hygiene
	5.	**Racial and gender bias**: criminal types linked with race/limited energy theory (brain and uteri) "seepage" (cultural pressures)like ESLD scientists- Diversity as epistemic insurance
	6.	**Simplifying assumptions and anchoring effects**: forget that they are assumptions (Hayford Spheroid:earth crest is uniform depth of compensation, latter considered fact but incompatible with continent drift) simplification is necessary but could cause problem
	7.	**Over generalization and over reach**: broadly applicable GMOs.
GMO is safe: over generalized (what do you mean? Safe to eat or safe to environment? Are they a good idea?)

##Final Words

> Take no drug on market less than seven years 

- clinical trials take time
- Peer review is the first step

- Truth is a process rather than result

Pragmatism's Conception of Truth by William James


- Relative consequence of accepting false vs rejecting true?
- Climate change: dire future
