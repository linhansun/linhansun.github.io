----------
### Direct delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 complex in plant cells

Woo, J. W. et al. **DNA-free genome editing in plants with preassembled CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins**. Nat. Biotechnol. 10–13 (2015). doi:10.1038/nbt.3389



- RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs)

- Cas9 protein-gRNA ribonucleoproteins(RNPs)

purfied Cas9 protein + *2~10 gRNAs

protoplast of Arabidopsis, rice, tobacco and lettuce

PEG transformation

- Mutation frequency test: T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assay; targeted deep sequencing

- in arabidoposis: 2 DSBs- targeted deletion of intervening sequence

- mutation detected after 24h after transfection!

- off target: almost no in lettuce

- mutation maintained afrer regeneration; transmittable to progeny

**Advantage of preassembled RGEN RNP delivery:**

- no foreign DNA plasmid (bypassing regulation?)

- fast mutation after transfection 

- degraded rapidly by proteases in cells (reduce mosaicism and off-target)

- no need to optimize codon and promoter (widely applicable)

- enables in vitro prescreening to guide the choice of highly active
gRNAs and genotyping of mutant clones via restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.

### Direct delivery of meganuclease and TALENs in plant cells

Luo, S. et al. **Non-transgenic Plant Genome Editing Using Purified Sequence-Specific Nucleases**. Mol. Plant 8, 1425–1427 (2015).

**meganuclease delivery**:

- smallest size of RGENs- easy delivery?

- I-SceI meganuclease alone: no mutagenesis detected

- I-SceI +Trex2 DNA: 7.7% mutagenesis

**TALENs delivery**:

- TALEN monomers: ALS2T1L/1R in tobacco

- TALEN protein: 1.4% mutagenesis

- TALEN plasmids: 18.6% mutagenesis
