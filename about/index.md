## About Me

I'm a first year graduate student in the Plant Biology Graduate Program at the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences at the Pennsylvania State Universty, PA. Currently I'm working in Dr.Teh-hui Kao's lab studying self-incompatibility (SI) mechanism of *Petunia inflata* with biochemistry, molecular biology and genomics.
